# Shahad Alkhattaf – My Portfolio Website
Hi! This is my personal portfolio website where I share my projects, skills, and how to get in touch with me. It’s built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Here’s a quick look
This is what the page looks like:
![about section](about_section) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
![about section](contactMe_section) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
![about section](projects_section) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;



## What you’ll find here
Clean, responsive design that works well on phones and desktops

Projects I’ve worked on with links to live demos or GitHub

A simple contact form that sends me messages directly

## How I built it
**HTML** and **CSS** for structure and style

**JavaScript** for interactive features like the menu and form

**Font Awesome** icons for a modern look

**Formspree** to handle contact form emails
